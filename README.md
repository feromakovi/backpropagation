BackPropagation
===============

Implementation of BackPropagation algorithm with input, hidden and output layer. All neurons used in application are binary. This simple application is written in Java programming language. Main purpose is to train sample neural network for solving theese problems:

- XOR
- Parity
- one optional problem (clasification, regression...)
